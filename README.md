# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Your Task

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. 

You’ll deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) to create a build that you can deploy.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Process Details

React was used, so first a React app was created and webpack was set up to bundle the source files.
I then took inspiration from [Kepplar](https://brunosimon.github.io/keppler/) for the page layout and built the needed sections.
After setting up the navigation and anchor tags, I incorporated bootstrap and added card components for my work.
The About and Contact sections came together quickly, so all that was left to finish the MVP portfolio is adding my signature at the bottom.


## Future Development
